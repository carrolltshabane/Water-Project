    "* **Purpose:** Introduce the project, outline its goals, and explain its significance.\n",
    "This project aims to analyze the physico-chemical parameters of a polluted river located in Buenos Aires. The primary objective is to assess the water quality and understand the extent of contamination, helping local authorities and environmental bodies implement effective remediation and conservation strategies. By evaluating key parameters, we can gain insights into the health risks posed to the surrounding ecosystem and communities, as well as monitor long-term trends in pollution levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Details:** Include information about the problem domain, the specific questions or challenges the project aims to address, and any relevant background information that sets the stage for the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project focuses on critical physico-chemical water parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrates, phosphates, and heavy metal concentrations. These parameters are vital for determining the water's suitability for human consumption, agriculture, and sustaining aquatic life.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study is particularly important given the industrial and urban pollutants that heavily impact rivers in Buenos Aires, contributing to environmental degradation. Specific challenges include identifying the sources of contamination, understanding seasonal variations in water quality, and determining the most affected areas. The analysis will also address the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Which parameters are consistently above safe levels?\n",
    "What are the potential sources of pollutants in this river?\n",
    "How do these contaminants affect both the ecosystem and public health?\n",
