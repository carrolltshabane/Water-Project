# Contaminated River Water Parameters Analysis

# Project Overview
This project analyzes the physico-chemical parameters of a polluted river in Buenos Aires to assess its water quality and identify potential sources of contamination. By leveraging a dataset from Kaggle, we perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and machine learning modeling to evaluate water quality trends and predict contamination levels.

# Project Goals
1. Evaluate the current state of water quality by analyzing key physico-chemical parameters.
2. Investigate correlations between various parameters to identify potential pollution sources and their impact on water quality.
3. Test hypotheses related to the factors affecting water quality and determine their statistical significance.
4. Develop predictive models to forecast water quality under varying conditions, enabling better resource management.
